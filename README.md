MyReads is a project from Udacity's React Nanodegree course. This is a bookshelf app that lets you to organize books that you have read.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). A subset of [instructions](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) is shown bellow:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`

To install all the dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Deployment

`npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favourite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file.
